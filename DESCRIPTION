Description: Methods for frontier
	analysis, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), under different
	technology assumptions (fdh, vrs, drs, crs, irs, add/frh, and fdh+),
	and using different efficiency measures (input based, output based,
	hyperbolic graph, additive, super, and directional efficiency). Peers
	and slacks are available, partial price information can be included,
	and optimal cost, revenue and profit can be calculated. Evaluation of
	mergers is also supported.  Methods for graphing the technology sets
	are also included. There is also support comparative methods based
	on Stochastic Frontier Analyses (SFA). In general, the methods can be
	used to solve not only standard models, but also many other model
	variants. It complements the book, Bogetoft and Otto,
	Benchmarking with DEA, SFA, and R, Springer-Verlag, 2011, but can of
	course also be used as a stand-alone package.
